# Portfolio

In this repository you are able to get a rough overview about my last projects.
Most are games but there are some more conventional projects.

## Game Builds to have some fun

[Here](https://github.com/Niodith/Portfolio/tree/master/GameBuilds "Game builds") you can find the last running builds of mainly Game Jam projects which were made in collaboration with artist and other programmers.
The [GameJams](https://www.semestergamejam.de/events/previous-events/ "GameJams") were roundaboud 100 participants in 20 - 30 teams.


### Ered Engrin
#### 3. Place Theme: Discovery
[Ered Engrin](https://github.com/Niodith/Portfolio/tree/master/GameBuilds/EredEngrin.zip "Ered Engrin") was without a doubt the most successful Game Jam Game I have been part of.
I was responsible for the main concept of the game, the title (which means "Iron Mountain" in Sindarin), the ice shader and the sound design as well as the last minute bug fixing.
The whole game is more based on a well-rounded overall experience than fancy game mechanics - the way the sound and the design interlock with each other gives a spooky and slightly threatening feeling.

### Freezing Goats
#### No price but lots of fun

Inspired by the so called fainting goats we made a multiplayer party game called [Freezing Goats](https://github.com/Niodith/Portfolio/tree/master/GameBuilds/FreezingGoats.zip "Freezing Goats") which was solely based on the idea to have as much fun as possible.
You are fighting your co-goats to get as high as possible and yeet each other into space - with super wiggly rigid bodies to laugh as much as possible.
Apart from my usual role as last minute bug fixer I was mainly responsible for the main concept and the controller programming to support diffrent kind of input devices.

### Galactinder
#### Theme: Attraction - taken way to literally

Totally coincidence that this game shares part of its name with a well known dating app - _well_ it is a dating app - but on intergalactic level!
With an intuitive UI you are able to choose your prefered type of alien - and get one of 36000 procedurally generated matches.
I was responsible for the basic concept and the implementation of the UI and rendering of the procedurally generated aliens.
You can find the build of Galactinder [here](https://github.com/Niodith/Portfolio/blob/master/GameBuilds/Galactinder.zip "here").

### Flappy Bird 2.0
#### Theme: Nightmare - honorable mention

It starts as a simple Flappy Bird style game - and you get pushed into a coders deepest fear - a nightmare where you are only able to escape when you _fix_ your code.

I did parts of the shader and designed the riddles you have to solve to escape the nightmare.

You can find the trailer for this game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWZ3SMBPXlU&ab_channel=ShyTeaGames "here").


And the running game (with some very nice poishes from Seb) [here](https://shytea.itch.io/flappybird2 "here") on itch.io.

### Brainfuck Planet
#### 3. Place - Theme: Depth

Brainfuck Planet is a platformer with a high atmospheric value - the artists design interplays with sound and enemy design. I was part of the overall design, the sound and last minuite bugfixing as well as for the naming (I can't believe people trusted me with naming things again after _this_).

Sadly I have no running build anymore because it requires a very old unity version (4+ years).

## Conventional projects

### NLP

In collaboration with a fellow class mate I supported with the technical implemantation of a natural processing AI in python.
It was mostly setting up a working linux enviorment with enough computing power - it was a fun side project and a good digression into data science and more python.

### Thesis for Computer Science Expert for Software Development

My thesis was related to my workplace in the automotive industry - it is an AR table for fare trade usage to show connected vehicles. The project was done in C# in unity with a small test framework.

## My current work

I am currently working in the automotive industry as an software developer and technical artist in an agile enviorment (which is important for me in as a Professional Scrum Developer and "agile native").
My main technologies are coding in hardware with C++, writing tests and tooling in Python and C++ as well as working with Lua and GLSL as a technical artist.

The automotive industry is very heavy with clean code and testing which a both important for healthy code - I am part of a team that reviews code according to automotive standarts and clean code for C++.
