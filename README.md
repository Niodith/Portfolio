# Portfolio

In this repository you are able to get a rough overview about my last few projects.

## Game Builds to have some fun

[Here](https://github.com/Niodith/Portfolio/tree/master/GameBuilds "Game builds") you can find the last running builds of mainly Game Jam projects which were made in collaboration with artist and other programmers.
### Ered Engrin
[Ered Engrin](https://github.com/Niodith/Portfolio/tree/master/GameBuilds/EredEngrin "Ered Engrin") was without doubt the most succesfull Game Jam Game I have been part of.
I was responisible for the main concept of the game, the title (which means "Iron Mountain" in Sindarin), the ice shader and the sound design as well as the last minute bug fixing.
The whole game is more based on a well-rounded overall experience than fancy game mechanics - the way the sound and the design interlock with each other gives a spooky and slightly threatening feeling.

### Freezing Goats

Inspired by the so called fainting goats we made a multiplayer party game called [Freezing Goats](https://github.com/Niodith/Portfolio/tree/master/GameBuilds/FreezingGoats "Freezing Goats") which was solely based on the idea to have as much fun as possible.
You are fighting your co-goats to get as high as possible and yeet each other into space - with super wiggly rigid bodies to laugh as much as possible.
Apart from my usual role as last minute bug fixer I was mainly responsible for the main concept and the controller programming to support diffrent kind of input devices.
